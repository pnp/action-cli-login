# action-cli-login
GitHub action to login to a tenant using Office 365 CLI.

![Office 365 CLI Login](./images/cli-login.png)

This GitHub Action (created using Docker container) uses [Office 365 CLI](https://pnp.github.io/office365-cli/), specifically the [login command](https://pnp.github.io/office365-cli/cmd/login), to allow you log in to Office 365.

## Usage
### Pre-requisites
Create a workflow `.yml` file in your `.github/workflows` directory. An [example workflow](#example-workflow---office-365-cli-login) is available below. For more information, reference the GitHub Help Documentation for [Creating a workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file).

### Inputs
For more information on these inputs, see the [API Documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#input)

- `ADMIN_USERNAME` : **Required** Username (email address of the admin)
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD` : **Required** Password of the admin

#### Optional requirement
Since this action requires user name and password which are sensitive pieces of information, it would be ideal to store them securely. We can achieve this in a GitHub repo by using [secrets](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets). So, click on `settings` tab in your repo and add 2 new secrets:
- `adminUsername` - store the admin user name in this (e.g. user@contoso.onmicrosoft.com)
- `adminPassword` - store the password of that user in this.
These secrets are encrypted and can only be used by GitHub actions.
